## Getting Around

The project structure is pretty simple:

```
.
|-- build          # Build folder
|-- AUTHORS        # Who made this!
|-- gruntfile.js   # Grunt build file
|-- bower.json     # Controls the dependent web components - `grunt bower-install`
|-- package.json   # The needed node modules - `npm install`
|-- CONTRIBUTE.md  # This file!
|-- LICENSE        # The license for the web component
|-- README.md      # Information about the project
| # The following is the HTML file to import to use the web component
`-- vca-polymer-test.html
```

## Adding New Features

We can always do with new features!  In general the workflow of creating a new feature is like this:

* Create a *proposal* issue for your new feature
    * This will notify the developers of what you are about to implement. They can give you some tips on what might be the best way to implement it or can advise on parts of the library that will help you along the way. The feature may also already be implemented just not public or hard to find.
* Fork the project into your own account
    * Click the `fork` button to create a clone of this repository into your personal account. This will allow you to work on the feature in isolation to the main repository.
* Implement the feature!
    * Use the created issue to communicate about the development of the feature. this will provide a centeralized point of information about the feature and will be the easiest way to ask the developers for help
* Create a merge request
    * When the feature is complete it will need to be merged into the main repository. This is done through a merge request which is easily started by clicking the `merge request` button in your personal repository and pointing the target of the request to the main repository
* Participate in a code review
    * When a merge request is created it starts a code review where the developers can review the code to make sure it fits in with the ethos of the project. The main driving force here is consistence across the project.
* Celebrate
    * When the developers are happy with the code review they will merge your code into the repository and it will be available to all users of the project. Time for a :beer:!
